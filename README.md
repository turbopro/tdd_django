# tdd_django
Remote host repo for local project based on "Test Driven Development with Python" [Harry Perceival]

This is just me learning how to improve my python programming skills, and, how to use 'django'.

Ultimately, I want to build a python based asset management database that should store/track/manage IT assets at my workplace.
